# 1ST_PROJECT_
# HR Analytics â€“ Predicting Employee Attrition

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing HR data to understand the reasons behind employee attrition and build a predictive model to identify potential attrition cases. It combines data exploration, machine learning, and dashboard visualization to provide actionable insights for HR decision-making.

---

# Objectives

- Analyze patterns of attrition based on features like department, salary, promotions, etc.
- Build a classification model to predict employee attrition.
- Visualize key factors influencing attrition using Power BI.
- Suggest data-driven strategies to reduce employee turnover.

#  Tools & Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- Dataset: `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`

---

# Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and transforming raw HR data
   - Handling null values, encoding categorical data

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Department-wise attrition
   - Promotion and salary band analysis
   - Visualization using seaborn

3. **Machine Learning Model**
   - Logistic Regression / Decision Tree Classification
   - Model evaluation using accuracy score & confusion matrix
   - SHAP value analysis for model interpretability

4. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Visual storytelling of attrition trends
   - Filters: Age group, Department, Job Role
   - Insight cards for key factors like overtime, satisfaction, and years at company

# Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 0.8673469387755102
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displayed in the Jupyter notebook
- **Interpretation**: Key drivers of attrition identified using SHAP
